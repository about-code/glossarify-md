# [Markdown Syntax Extensions](#markdown-syntax-extensions)

<!--
aliases: Markdown syntax extensions
-->

[glossarify-md][1] supports [CommonMark ðŸŒŽ][2] and [GitHub Flavoured Markdown ðŸŒŽ][3] (GFM). Syntax not covered by these specifications may have no or worse, a wrong representation in the tool's Abstract Syntax Tree ([mdAst ðŸŒŽ][4]). As a consequence it may not make it correctly into output documents. For example *Frontmatter* syntax is a Markdown syntax extension popularized by many static site generators:

*Frontmatter Syntax*

    ---
    key: This is a frontmatter
    ---

Without special support for it [CommonMark ðŸŒŽ][2] compliant parsers like our [remark ðŸŒŽ][5] parser will interpret the line of trailing dashes as *heading* markers and the text before them as *heading text*. So to make our parser aware of frontmatter syntax we need to enhance it.

**Since v5.0.0** we have opened [glossarify-md][1] to the [remark ðŸŒŽ][5] plug-in ecosystem and its support of additional syntaxes and tools. More see [Installing Plug-ins][6] and [Writing a Plug-in][7].
