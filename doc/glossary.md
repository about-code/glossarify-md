# [Glossary](#glossary)

[glossarify-md][1]: [https://github.com/about-code/glossarify-md][2]

This is a glossary of terms helpful when working with [glossarify-md][1] or reading its docs. It also servers as an example and is processed by *glossarify-md* itself using the [glossarify-md.conf.json][3] configuration at the root of this repo.

## [Alias](#alias)

A sementically similar or equivalent alternative name for a [termâ˜…][4]. May also be used to link grammatical variants of a term with a term definition.

## [Term](#term)

A [termâ˜…][4] is a heading in a markdown file which is passed to [glossarify-md][1] as a glossary.

## [Term Attribute](#term-attribute)

<!--{ "aliases": "term attributes, term-attribute" }-->

[Termâ˜…][4] Attributes are properties passed to [glossarify-md][1] using an HTML comment syntax `<!--{...}-->` which encodes a JSON string:

*glossary.md*

```md
# Term
<!--{ "term-attr": "This is a term attribute." }-->
...
```

## [Term Hint](#term-hint)

<!--{ "aliases": "term hint, term-hint" }-->

An optional (symbol-) character like for example `ðŸŸ‰` decorating a [termâ˜…][4] link to distinguish it from a regular link.
See [glossarify-md][1] configuration options for details.

## [Vocabulary](#vocabulary)

<!--{ "aliases": "vocabularies, Formal Ontologies" }-->

[vocabularies]: https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology

A collection of terms which is uniquely identifiable. See also [Semantic Web Vocabularies and Ontologies][vocabularies].

## [Linkification](#linkification)

Process of searching for a [termâ˜…][4] in *document A* matching a heading phrase in
*document B* and replacing the term in *document A* with a Markdown link pointing
onto the term definition in *document B*.

## [Slug](#slug)

<!--{ "aliases": "slug, slugs" }-->

A [slugâ˜…][5] is a URL-friendly identifier that can be used within [URL fragmentsâ˜…][6] to address headings / sections on a page.

## [URL fragment](#url-fragment)

<!-- Aliases: URL fragments -->

The fragment is the part follwing the `#` in a [URLâ˜…][7].

## [URI / URL](#uri--url)

<!--{ "aliases": "URI, URL" }-->

*Uniform Resource Identifier* and *Uniform Resource Locator* are both the same thing, which is an ID with a syntax `scheme://authority.tld/path/#fragment?query` like `https://my.org/foo/#bar?q=123`. Although both things are the same, the two acronyms are often used to emphasize whether using the ID to primarily *identify* something or using *the same ID* to *also* locate and retrieve a represention of what it identifies.

## [KOS - Knowledge Organization Systems](#kos---knowledge-organization-systems)

<!--{ "aliases": "KOS, Knowledge Organization System" }-->

Glossaries are considered a kind of *Knowledge Organisation System ([KOSâ˜…][8])* which organizes knowledge as a list of terms and [termâ˜…][4] definitions. There are other KOS like *Thesauri*, *Taxonomies* or *Word Nets* which add term relationships (hierarchically or as graphs capturing semantic or linguistic relationships). To model informal KOS the W3C has developed [SKOS][9].

[Formal Ontologiesâ˜…][10] are graph-like [KOSâ˜…][8] which focus on *logical formalism*. They are built from logical statements and tend to become harder to maintain as they grow due to a requirement of being *fully free of logical conflicts*. Ontologies require a (meta-) vocabulary known as the *Web Ontology Language* [OWL][11]. [SKOS][9] was built on top of OWL.
