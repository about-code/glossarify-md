# [Glossary](#glossary)

This is a [glossary][1] of terms helpful when working with [glossarify-md][2] or reading its docs. It also serves as an example and is processed by glossarify-md itself using the [glossarify-md.conf.json][3] [configuration][4] at the root of this repo.

## [Alias](#alias)

An alternative [term][5] or spelling for a term.

## [Term](#term)

Terms are headings in a markdown file which has been configured to be a *[glossary][1] file*.

## [Term Attribute](#term-attribute)

<!-- aliases: term attributes, term-attribute -->

[Term Attributes][6] are passed in a comment following a [term][5]'s heading. The comment must adhere to YAML syntax.

## [Term Hint](#term-hint)

<!-- aliases: term hint, term-hint -->

An optional (symbol-) character like for example `â†´` decorating a [term][5] link to distinguish it from a regular link.
See [glossarify-md][2] [configuration][4] options for details.

## [Vocabulary](#vocabulary)

<!-- aliases: vocabularies, Formal Ontologies -->

[vocabularies]: https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology

A collection of terms which is uniquely identifiable. See also [Semantic Web Vocabularies and Ontologies][vocabularies].

## [Linkification](#linkification)

Process of searching for a [term][5] in *document A* matching a heading phrase in
*document B* and replacing the term in *document A* with a Markdown link pointing
onto the term definition in *document B*.

## [Slug](#slug)

<!-- aliases: slug, slugs -->

A [slug][7] is a URL-friendly identifier that can be used within [URL fragments][8] to address headings / sections on a page.

## [URL fragment](#url-fragment)

<!-- aliases: URL fragments -->

The fragment is the part follwing the `#` in a [URL][9].

## [URI / URL](#uri--url)

<!-- aliases: URI, URL -->

*Uniform Resource Identifier* and *Uniform Resource Locator* are both the same thing, which is an ID with a syntax `scheme://authority.tld/path/#fragment?query` like `https://my.org/foo/#bar?q=123`. Although both things are the same, the two acronyms are often used to emphasize whether using the ID to primarily *identify* something or using *the same ID* to *also* locate and retrieve a represention of what it identifies.

## [KOS - Knowledge Organization Systems](#kos---knowledge-organization-systems)

<!-- aliases: KOS, Knowledge Organization System -->

Glossaries are considered a kind of *Knowledge Organisation System ([KOS][10])* which organizes knowledge as a list of terms and [term][5] definitions. There are other KOS like *Thesauri*, *Taxonomies* or *Word Nets* which add term relationships (hierarchically or as graphs capturing semantic or linguistic relationships). To model informal KOS the W3C has developed [SKOS ðŸŒŽ][11].

[Formal Ontologies][12] are graph-like [KOS][10] which focus on *logical formalism*. They are built from logical statements and tend to become harder to maintain as they grow due to a requirement of being *fully free of logical conflicts*. Ontologies require a (meta-) vocabulary known as the *Web Ontology Language* [OWL ðŸŒŽ][13]. [SKOS ðŸŒŽ][11] was built on top of OWL.
