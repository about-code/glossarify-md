# [Glossary (Terms and Concepts of glossarify-md)](#glossary-terms-and-concepts-of-glossarify-md)

This is a glossary of terms helpful when working with [glossarify-md][1] or reading its docs. It also serves as an example and is processed by [glossarify-md][1] itself using the [glossarify-md.conf.json][2] [configuration][3] at the root of this repo.

## [Alias](#alias)

An alternative [term][4] or spelling for a [term][4].

## [Term](#term)

Terms are headings in a markdown file which has been configured to be a *glossary file*.

## [Term Attribute](#term-attribute)

<!-- aliases: term attributes, term-attribute -->

[Term][4] Attributes are passed in a comment following a [term][4]'s heading. The comment must adhere to YAML syntax.

## [Term Hint](#term-hint)

<!-- aliases: term hint, term-hint -->

An optional (symbol-) character like for example `â†´` decorating a [term][4] link to distinguish it from a regular link.
See [glossarify-md][1] [configuration][3] options for details.

## [Vocabulary](#vocabulary)

<!-- aliases: vocabularies, Formal Ontologies -->

[vocabularies]: https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology

A collection of terms which is uniquely identifiable. See also [Semantic Web Vocabularies and Ontologies][vocabularies].

## [Linkification](#linkification)

Process of searching for a [term][4] in *document A* matching a heading phrase in
*document B* and replacing the [term][4] in *document A* with a Markdown link pointing
onto the [term][4] definition in *document B*.

## [Slug](#slug)

<!-- aliases: slug, slugs -->

A [slug][5] is a URL-friendly identifier that can be used within [URL fragments][6] to address headings / sections on a page.

## [URL fragment](#url-fragment)

<!-- aliases: URL fragments -->

The fragment is the part follwing the `#` in a [URL][7].

## [URI / URL](#uri--url)

<!-- aliases: URI, URL -->

*Uniform Resource Identifier* and *Uniform Resource Locator* are both the same thing, which is an ID with a syntax `scheme://authority.tld/path/#fragment?query` like `https://my.org/foo/#bar?q=123`. Although both things are the same, the two acronyms are often used to emphasize whether using the ID to primarily *identify* something or using *the same ID* to *also* locate and retrieve a represention of what it identifies.

## [KOS - Knowledge Organization Systems](#kos---knowledge-organization-systems)

<!-- aliases: KOS, Knowledge Organization System -->

Glossaries are considered a kind of *Knowledge Organisation System ([KOS][8])* which organizes knowledge as a list of terms and [term][4] definitions. There are other [KOS][8] like *Thesauri*, *Taxonomies* or *Word Nets* which add [term][4] relationships (hierarchically or as graphs capturing semantic or linguistic relationships). To model informal [KOS][8] the W3C has developed [SKOS ðŸŒŽ][9].

[Formal Ontologies][10] are graph-like [KOS][8] which focus on *logical formalism*. They are built from logical statements and tend to become harder to maintain as they grow due to a requirement of being *fully free of logical conflicts*. Ontologies require a (meta-) [vocabulary][10] known as the *Web Ontology Language* [OWL ðŸŒŽ][11]. [SKOS ðŸŒŽ][9] was built on top of [OWL ðŸŒŽ][11].
