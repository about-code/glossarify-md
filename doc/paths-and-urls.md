# [Paths and URLs](#paths-and-urls)

When using [glossarify-md][1] with a static website renderer it may be necessary to tweak links and [link paths][2] a bit. There are quite a few `linking` options which affect how links will be generated. They'll be explained in a bit more detail here:

## [`paths` and `baseUrl`](#paths-and-baseurl)

**Rules of thumb**:

*   Absolute paths *most likely* do require `baseUrl`, too
*   Use `baseUrl` with `paths: absolute` if link targets should be located by a [URL][3]
*   Use `baseUrl: "/"` with `paths: absolute` if you would like to have links with paths rooted in `outDir`

```json
{
  "linking": {
    "baseUrl": "https://my-site.org/",
    "paths": "absolute"
  }
}
```

## [`pathComponents`](#pathcomponents)

**Rules of thumb**:

*   Use `pathComponents` if you just want to keep or drop some components of a path
*   Use `pathRewrites` otherwise

*Example: Omitting `"ext"` file extension component in links produced by [glossarify-md][1]*

```json
{
  "linking": {
    "pathRewrites": "pathComponents": ["path", "file"]
  }
}
```

## [`pathRewrites`](#pathrewrites)

**Rules of thumb**:

*   Path rewriting won't change the output directory structure *but links, only*.
*   Rewriting *URLs* requires URLs being based on `baseUrl`. Use with `paths: absolute`.
*   Rewriting *paths* might be easier when they're absolute. Relative paths vary between file's.
    *   Use `paths: absolute` together with `baseUrl` (e.g `baseUrl: "/"`)
*   Rewrite rules will be applied to all Markdown links not just those generated by [glossarify-md][1]
*   In a `pathRewrites` config map *keys are the replacer*, *values can be one or more (regular) search expressions*

*Example: changing file extensions present in links*

```json
{
  "linking": {
    "pathRewrites": { ".html": ".md" }
  }
}
```

**Example:** Given a nested [glossarify-md][1] input directory. [glossarify-md][1] copies the same structure to its output directory. A post processor flattens output directory and moves files into `/files/` and images into `/images/` but doesn't change links inside the Markdown files. Then you could rewrite paths with:

```json
{
  "linking": {
    "pathRewrites": {
        "/images/$2.$3": ["(.*)/(.*).(png|jpg|svg|gif)"],
        "/files/$1.md": ["/(.*)/(.*).md"]
    }
  }
}
```
