# [Internals: Conceptual Layers](#internals-conceptual-layers)

Conceptual layers and projects contributing to the layer

| Layer | Project         | Conceptual purpose                                                           |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | [glossarify-md] | cross-linking multiple markdown files                                        |
| 3     | [unified]       | umbrella project for *text file processing in general*                       |
| 2     | [remark]        | [unifiedðŸŸ‰][1] *processor* for *markdown text file processing in particular* |
| 1     | [micromark]     | remarks internal markdown syntax tokenizer                                   |
| 0     | [CommonMark]    | Informal Markdown Syntax Specification                                       |

[glossarify-md] is built on [unified], an umbrella project for *text file processing in general*. We use [unifiedðŸŸ‰][1] with [remark], which in conceptual terms of unified is a *processor* for *Markdown text files in particular*. [remarkðŸŸ‰][2] itself only supports the [CommonMark] specification via its *internal* [micromark] parser/tokenizer.

That's why you need to install additional [remark plug-ins][remark-plugins] when you need extended Markdown syntax. Those plug-ins then usually install and depend on a [micromark] extension to parse and tokenize that syntax. We omitted for simplicity that [glossarify-md] already installs [remark-gfm] to also support popular [GitHub Flavoured Markdown][GFM] syntax (e.g. tables and footnotes).

Unless told you by any [remark plug-in][remark-plugins] you won't likely have to install any micromark extensions yourself when using [glossarify-md]. Just stick with [remark plug-ins][remark-plugins] on layer 2. They should declare their [micromark] requirements for themselves.
