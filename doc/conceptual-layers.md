[Conceptual layers][1] of text processing by [glossarify-md][2] and projects contributing to each layer

[glossarify-md][2] is built on [unified ðŸŒŽ][3], an umbrella project for *text file processing in general*. We use unified with [remark ðŸŒŽ][4] which in conceptual terms of unified is a *processor* for *Markdown text files in particular*. remark itself is built on (or better *wrapping around*) [micromark ðŸŒŽ][6] which is a low-level parser/tokenizer operating on a stream of individual character symbols which drive a token state machine. micromark can be considered a technical implementation of the textual [CommonMark ðŸŒŽ][7] specification.

When looking for non-standard [Markdown syntax extensions][8] you should be looking for [remark ðŸŒŽ][4] [plug-ins][9]. Those plug-ins are likely to depend on and transitively install their preferred or required [micromark ðŸŒŽ][6] extension themselves. Others may operate on layer 2 using a simpler RegEx parsing. One plug-in [glossarify-md][2] already installs itself is [remark-gfm ðŸŒŽ][10] which adds support for the popular [CommonMark ðŸŒŽ][7] syntax extension [GitHub Flavoured Markdown ðŸŒŽ][11] (tables, footnotes and more).
