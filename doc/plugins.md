The following example demonstrates how to install [remark-frontmatter], a [remark plug-in][remark-plugin] to make [glossarify-md][1] handle non-standard *Frontmatter* syntax, correctly.

> **â“˜  Note:** glossarify-md does not guarantee compatibility with plug-ins and likely won't help with issues arising due to installing and using additional third-party plug-ins.

We'll assume the following project structure:

    ${root}
       +- docs/                        (baseDir)
       +- docs-glossarified/           (outDir)
       +- node_modules/
       |- glossarify-md.conf.json
       |- package.json
       '- .gitignore

**1:** Install [remark-frontmatter]:

    npm install remark-frontmatter

**2:** In your `glossarify-md.conf.json` add:

```json
{
  "unified": {
    "plugins": {
      "remark-frontmatter": {
        "type": "yaml",
        "marker": "-"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Keys of the `plugins` object tell what to load and may be:

*   *names of [npm][2] packages*
*   *paths of JavaScript modules.*

Their value in turn are options passed to the plug-in. Read [remark-frontmatter] docs, to find out about available options.

> â“˜ The `unified` key embeds a [unified configuration][unified-config] object. Its schema is *not* subject to glossarify-md's own config schema, anymore. Thus, if you would like to have the configs separated a bit more clearly, then you can split them:
>
> **3:** Create a file `unified.conf.json` next to `glossarify-md.conf.json`
>
> **4:** Copy the value of `unified` to `unified.conf.json`:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "plugins": {
>     "remark-frontmatter": {
>       "type": "yaml",
>       "marker": "-"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> **5:** In `glossarify-md.conf.json` replace `plugins` with `rcPath` (rooted in `outDir`, so you need to step out):
>
> ```json
> {
>   "unified": {
>     "rcPath": "../unified.conf.json"
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> If you would like to learn more about how *unified* and *remark* relate to glossarify-md, read [Conceptual Layers][doc-conceptual-layers].

## [Writing a Plug-In](#writing-a-plug-in)

### [Syntax Plug-Ins](#syntax-plug-ins)

Syntax Plug-ins extend Markdown syntax itself, like [remark-frontmatter], for example. They contribute new *node types* to an internal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Further they provide a tokenizer to parse and a serializer to write markdown files. Writing syntax plug-ins is a bit more elaborate. At this point we like to refer you to the documentation of [micromark][3] and [mdAst][4]. When exploring these projects you might find this [description of the overall process][remark-discussion] helpful.

### [Tree-Plug-Ins](#tree-plug-ins)

*Tree plug-ins* operate on a markdown syntax tree ([mdAST][4]). They are much easier to write and use [CommonMark][5] and [GFM][6] syntax and respective AST node types to do their job. Basically they inspect, add, remove or resort AST nodes. [glossarify-md][1] operates on tree plug-ins, almost only (see [Conceptual Layers][doc-conceptual-layers]).

A tree plug-in is a function which returns a callback that when called get's passed an [mdAst][4] root node (`tree`):

*remark-my-plug-in.js*

```js
import { visit } from "unist-util-visit";

/**
 * Plugin to add an additional query parameter to each URL
 *
 * @type {import('unified').Plugin<[Options?]|void[], Root>}
 */
export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return (tree) => {
    return visit(tree, "link", (node, parent, index) => {
      node.url += "&visited=true";
      return node;
    });
  };
}
```

The example simply adds a `&visited=true` [URLðŸŸ‰][7] query parameter to each Markdown link in a document.

It uses a [visit][mdast-util-visit] utility function with a filter argument (2) and visitor callback argument (3). The filter argument can be the name of a node type or a filter function which gets passed a node and is expected to return a boolean.  For a list of [CommonMark][5] node types see [mdAst][4]. Eventually, the plug-in function returns the tree's root node again.
Note the `options` argument: this is how your plug-in would get passed its config options (see [Installing Plug-Ins][8]).

Let's save the plug-in to *plugins/remark-my-plug-in.js* next to `outDir`:

    ${root}
       +- docs/                        (baseDir)
       +- docs-glossarified/           (outDir)
       +- node_modules/
       +- plugins
       |     '- remark-my-plug-in.js   <=== your plug-in
       |- glossarify-md.conf.json
       |- remark.conf.json
       |- package.json
       '- .gitignore

In your `glossarify-md.conf.json` add:

```json
{
  "unified": {
    "plugins": {
      "../plugins/remark-my-plug-in.js": { "your": "options" }
    }
  }
}
```

The plug-in path is rooted in `outDir` so you need to step out.
That's it. Run [glossarify-md][1] again and check the links in Markdown files in your output directory.

## [Writing a Plug-in Package](#writing-a-plug-in-package)

If you aim for publishing a plug-in, here's how you could set up a plug-in package project next to a [glossarify-md][1] project:

1.  Make a new directory *remark-my-plug-in* next to `${root}` and initialize it as an [npm][2] package.

        mkdir ./remark-my-plug-in
        cd ./remark-my-plug-in
        npm init

2.  Open your `package.json` and add

        "type": "module",
        "exports": "./index.js",

3.  Copy the JavaScript code sample or `remark-my-plug-in.js` (see prev. section) to a file `index.js`

4.  Install the [npm][2] dependency required by the code sample

        npm install unist-util-visit

5.  You're now set with your plug-in. This step will make your package usuable, *locally*, with symlinking (since it's not yet published to [npm][2]).

    `cd` into your [glossarify-md][1] project and create another symlink onto the global symlink:

        npm link ../remark-my-plug-in

    > **Important:** Ths step needs to be repeated whenever you ran `npm install` in your glossarify-md project.

    You now virtually "installed" your plug-in to your [glossarify-md][1] project similar as if you had run `npm install remark-my-plug-in` to fetch it from the [npm][2] registry. What's left is configuring glossarify-md to use it (see also previous section):

6.  Add to your *[glossarify-md][1].conf.json*

        unified: {
           "plugins": {
             "remark-my-plug-in": { "your": "options" }
           }
        }

7.  Delete your `outDir`, run [glossarify-md][1] again and see whether link output changed.

## [Publishing a Plug-in Package](#publishing-a-plug-in-package)

Prior to publishing check what would get published:

    npm pack

The command creates a `tar.gz` file. Inspect its contents. Optionally, use a `files` whitelist in `package.json` to select which files should go into a package.

> Prior to publishing to the official npm registry, you may also find setting up a test registry on `localhost` useful. See [verdaccio], for an example.
