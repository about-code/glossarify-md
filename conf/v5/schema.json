When using a positive value, then the system creates links _no more than ..._ alternative links. If the number is negative then the absolute amount indicates to _not link a term at all once there are at least ..._ alternative definitions. For example: \n 1 linkifies the term in text and adds a link to 1 alternative definition (superscript),\n 0 only linkifies the term in text but adds 0 links to alternative definitions,\n -1 does not linkify a term in text once there is at least 1 alternative definition.\nNegative values may also be helpful when using 'glossaries' option with a glob pattern and there are multiple documents that follow a certain template and thus repeatedly declare the same heading (= term)."
