# Testing a config with multiple glossaries

WHEN there are two or more glossaries with a disjunct set of terms THEN "Term Disjunct A" MUST be linked WITH glossary-disjunct-a.

WHEN there are two or more glossaries with a disjunct set of terms THEN "Term Disjunct B" MUST be linked WITH glossary-disjunct-b.

WHEN there are two or more glossaries with a common set of terms THEN "Term Common" MUST Be linked WITH
glossary-common-a AND glossary-common-b.
