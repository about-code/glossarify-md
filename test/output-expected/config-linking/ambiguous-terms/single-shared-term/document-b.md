GIVEN two glossaries 'Glossary A' and 'Glossary B'
AND a term '[Shared Term][1][<sup>2)</sup>][2]' defined in both glossaries
AND a term '[Distinct Term B][3]' defined in Glossary B, only
THEN

*   the first definition linked with the shared term MUST be the definition in Glossary B
*   the second definition linked with the shared term MUST be the definition in Glossary A

because of

*   occurrence of an unambiguous term of Glossary B
*   AND NOT occurrence of some unambiguous term of Glossary A
