> GIVEN a blockquote THEN "Lorem ipsum" MUST NOT be linked to a glossary.

<!--
Linking quotes might be subject to debate. A writer
may not know if the person he or she quotes really
shares the same definition of a term. Linking to a
definition from within of a quote may be perceived
as to make the definition part of the quote.
Therefore we decide for the moment to exclude them.
