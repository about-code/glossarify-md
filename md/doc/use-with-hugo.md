Below we provide a few *examples* on how you *might* be able to facilitate glossarify-md in a Hugo project. But note that existence of this page is not a statement about *Hugo compatibility*.

## Setup

> âš  If your project is not under version control make a copy of your Hugo project.

1. Install NodeJS and npm
1. Install glossarify-md
   ~~~
   npm install -g glossarify-md
   ~~~
1. In your hugo project rename `content` to `content_`.


## Install Plug-Ins

Hugo supports some Markdown syntax not [supported out-of-the-box by glossarify-md][doc-mdext-syntax]. See the table below which syntax in the left column requires [installing and configuring a plug-in][doc-plugins] in the right column. See the plug-in's docs for available config options and default values.

|    Markdown Syntax Extension    | plug-in required with glossarify-md |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [Frontmatter][hugo-frontmatter] | remark-frontmatter                  |
| [Shortcodes][hugo-shortcodes]   | remark-shortcodes                   |
| ...and maybe others             |                                     |

## Configure glossarify-md...

*glossarify-md.conf.json*
~~~json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/about-code/glossarify-md/v5.1.0/conf/v5/schema.json",
  "baseDir": "./content_",
  "outDir": "../content",
  "unified": {
    "plugins": {
      "remark-frontmatter": {},
      "remark-shortcodes": {
        "startBlock": "{{<",
        "endBlock": ">}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

### ...for a Hugo "Leaf Bundle Structure"

In a Hugo [Leaf Bundle Structure][hugo-page-bundles]

- each directory represents a page
- the main content is in an `index.md` Markdown file
- only the directory name will be part of the page's URL path segments.

Its easier to configure glossarify-md for a Leaf Bundle Structure:

~~~
${root}
   +- content_/
   |   +- home/
   |   |   '- index.md
   |   |          .-----------------
   |   |         | # Home
   |   |         |
   |   |         | What is Hugo?
   |   |         ~
   |   +- company/
   |   +- products/
   |   +- glossary/
   |       '- index.md
   |             .--------------------------------
   |             | # Glossary
   |             |
   |             | ## Hugo
   |             | Hugo is a static site renderer.
   |             ~
   +- content/
   +- data/
   +- layouts/
   +- ...
   |- config.toml
   '- glossarify-md.conf.json
~~~

*Add to glossarify-md.conf.json*

~~~json
{
  "linking": {
    "pathComponents": ["path"],
    "headingAsLink": false
  },
  "glossaries": [{
    "file": "./glossary/index.md"
  }],
}
~~~

Then run

~~~
glossarify-md --config ./glossarify-md.conf.json
~~~

You should now see the files in `content_` copied to `content` where they will be picked up by Hugo. Should you have any troubles with paths, see also [`linking` options][doc-readme].

### ...for a Hugo "Branch Bundle Structure"

In a Hugo [Branch Bundle Structure][hugo-page-bundles]

- Markdown files in the directory represent individual pages
- each directory has an `_index.md` Markdown file
- directory *and* file names (without file extension) become URL path segments.

~~~
${root}
   +- content_/
   |   +- home/
   |   |   |- _index.md
   |   |   '- home.md
   |   |         .-----------------
   |   |         | # Home
   |   |         |
   |   |         | What is Hugo?
   |   |         ~
   |   +- company/
   |   +- products/
   |   +- glossary/
   |       |- _index.md
   |       '- glossary.md
   |             .--------------------------------
   |             | # Glossary
   |             |
   |             | ## Hugo
   |             | Hugo is a static site renderer.
   |             ~
   +- content/
   +- data/
   +- layouts/
   +- ...
   |- config.toml
   '- glossarify-md.conf.json
~~~

*Add to glossarify-md.conf.json*:

~~~json
{
  "linking": {
    "pathComponents": ["path", "file"],
    "headingAsLink": false
  },
  "glossaries": [{
    "file": "./glossary/glossary.md"
  }],
}
~~~


## Known Issues

### Different Flavours of "Markdown"

https://github.com/about-code/glossarify-md/issues/246

Hugo and glossarify-md support an overlapping, yet not identical set of Markdown syntax constructs. They share the common set of CommonMark and GFM constructs. But there is a chance Hugo supports additional features neither in Commonmark nor GFM. As a glossarify-md-with-Hugo user you may

- need to restrict yourself to using the common set of syntax, only
- or need to [install a syntax plug-in][doc-plugins], when there's one available
- or need to step back from glossarify-md given you can't sacrifice certain Hugo features.


### Shortcodes in Markdown Links

https://github.com/about-code/glossarify-md/issues/165#issuecomment-1086874898

glossarify-md can be enhanced with syntax plug-ins to accept shortcode syntax. But it won't be able to support certain combinations of CommonMark syntax *and* shortcode syntax, e.g. CommonMark link syntax `[]()` combined with shortcode syntax `{{< relref >}}` to something like `[Foo]({{< relref bar >}})`. glossarify-md requires valid CommonMark input but the combined syntax [is not valid CommonMark][hugo-cm-compliance] (as of CommonMark v0.30).

### Things get escaped with `\`

There may be two reasons:

1. input files use custom syntax not understood by glossarify-md. See known issue *Different flavors of Markdown*, above.
2. there is an improper combination of CommonMark syntax elements and non-standard syntax which violates the CommonMark spec. For an example, see known issue *Shortcodes in Markdown Links*, above.

### Link paths

Hugo has its own means of producing website URLs from a project's filesystem. We have shown glossarify-md configurations that fit a particular project structure but they have not been tested beyond a few simple Hugo demo pages. Feel free to experiment with glossarify-md options and `linking`-options in particular if the config doesn't work for you.
