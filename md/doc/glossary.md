# Glossary

This is a glossary with terms to be processed by *glossarify-md* using this
[glossarify-md.conf.json](../glossarify-md.conf.json) configuration in the root
of this repo. Some terms may be mentioned in other documents in the `./demo`
directory. Glossarified outputs will then be written to [`../doc/`](../doc/).
Term links created from this glossary can be recognised by a *term hint*.

## URI
<!-- Aliases: URL -->

*Uniform Resource Identifier* and *Uniform Resource Locator* describe both the same thing, which is an ID with a syntax `scheme://host.tld/path/#fragment?query` like `https://my.org/foo/#bar?q=123`. The two acronyms are often used to distinguish between two use cases: using the ID to purely identify something or using *the same ID* to *also* locate and retrieve a represention of what it identifies.

For example there's no strict requirement that URIs must resolve to a web page. They are just IDs. However URIs *can* be used to *locate and retrieve* a textual representation *of what they identify* which is when they are often called URL. A *representation* can be a web page. But an URI could als identify a technical device and could be used as an URL to locate a representation of that device in form of a datasheet.

URIs continue to be IDs after a particular representation like the datasheet disappears. This sometimes leads to controversies on whether a certain URL which is also an URI can ever be "reused" to locate something different than what the URI identified.

Strictly spoken: it *should not* because URLs and URIs *are equivalent* and two sides of the same coin. A URL should be reserved to locate and serve a representation of what itself *being a URI* identifies. If it doesn't it no longer identifies *a single* thing but two different things and loses its purpose as *identifier*.

However, it is a matter of fact that URLs and the web page content they identify and locate change thousands of times every day world wide. Because often it simply doesn't matter *what exactly* an URI/URL identifies but just that it identifies and locates *something*. Therefore you may only really care about "durability" of an URI/URL if your audience cares or if you really want to identify a particular thing.

If you're afraid of making a long-term comittment on a particular URI because you "might want to reuse the URL", then there's a simple solution: just add additional elements like "time", "randomness" or "uniqueness" to the URI/URL's `/path/...` or `#fragment` part to make it *unlikely* of being reused for something else.

In case of glossarify-md you could use one of the cryptographic heading ID algorithms like `md5` or `sha256` supported by [`headingIdAlgorithm`][headingIdAlgorithm].

## slug

A slug by our definition is a URL-friendly identifier created from arbitrary text that can be used within URL fragments to address headings / sections on a page.

## URL fragment
<!-- Aliases: URL fragments -->

URLs have a structure `scheme://domain.topleveldomain[/path][#fragment][?query[&query]]`. The fragment is the part follwing the `#` (URL hash).

## Term Hint

An optional (symbol-) character like for example `â†´` decorating a term link to distinguish it from a regular link.
See glossarify-md configuration options for details.

## Linkification

Process of searching for a term in *document A* matching a heading phrase in
*document B* and replacing the term in *document A* with a Markdown link pointing
onto the term definition in *document B*.
