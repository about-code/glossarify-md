# Glossary

This is a glossary of terms helpful when working with glossarify-md or reading its docs. It also serves as an example and is processed by glossarify-md itself using the [glossarify-md.conf.json](../glossarify-md.conf.json) configuration at the root of this repo.

## Alias

An alternative term or spelling for a term.

## Term

Terms are headings in a markdown file which has been configured to be a *glossary file*.

## Term Attribute
<!-- aliases: term attributes, term-attribute -->

Term Attributes are passed in a comment following a term's heading. The comment must adhere to YAML syntax.

## Term Hint
<!-- aliases: term hint, term-hint -->

An optional (symbol-) character like for example `â†´` decorating a term link to distinguish it from a regular link.
See glossarify-md configuration options for details.

## Vocabulary
<!-- aliases: vocabularies, Formal Ontologies -->
[vocabularies]: https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology

A collection of terms which is uniquely identifiable. See also [Semantic Web Vocabularies and Ontologies][vocabularies].

## Linkification

Process of searching for a term in *document A* matching a heading phrase in
*document B* and replacing the term in *document A* with a Markdown link pointing
onto the term definition in *document B*.

## Slug
<!-- aliases: slug, slugs -->

A slug is a URL-friendly identifier that can be used within URL fragments to address headings / sections on a page.

## URL fragment
<!-- aliases: URL fragments -->

The fragment is the part follwing the `#` in a URL.

## URI / URL
<!-- aliases: URI, URL -->

*Uniform Resource Identifier* and *Uniform Resource Locator* are both the same thing, which is an ID with a syntax `scheme://authority.tld/path/#fragment?query` like `https://my.org/foo/#bar?q=123`. Although both things are the same, the two acronyms are often used to emphasize whether using the ID to primarily *identify* something or using *the same ID* to *also* locate and retrieve a represention of what it identifies.

## KOS - Knowledge Organization Systems
<!-- aliases: KOS, Knowledge Organization System -->

Glossaries are considered a kind of *Knowledge Organisation System (KOS)* which organizes knowledge as a list of terms and term definitions. There are other KOS like *Thesauri*, *Taxonomies* or *Word Nets* which add term relationships (hierarchically or as graphs capturing semantic or linguistic relationships). To model informal KOS the W3C has developed SKOS.

Formal Ontologies are graph-like KOS which focus on *logical formalism*. They are built from logical statements and tend to become harder to maintain as they grow due to a requirement of being *fully free of logical conflicts*. Ontologies require a (meta-) vocabulary known as the *Web Ontology Language* OWL. SKOS was built on top of OWL.
